description: Safely evolve CardSense shared contracts (JSON Schema, enums, DTOs) across all four repos — contracts, extractor, API, and web — with backward-compatibility checks and cross-repo validation.

# CardSense Contract Evolution

Use this skill when a change to `cardsense-contracts` (JSON Schema, enum, DTO) is needed and must propagate safely across the extractor, API, and frontend.

## When to use

- Adding a new field to `promotion-normalized.schema.json`
- Adding a new enum value (category, subcategory, channel, condition type, etc.)
- Changing recommendation request/response schema
- Adding or modifying `benefit-plan.schema.json`
- Updating taxonomy definitions

## Core principles

- **Contracts are the source of truth** — all repos must conform to the schema
- **Additive changes are safe** — new optional fields, new enum values
- **Breaking changes require coordination** — removing fields, changing types, renaming
- **Validate in dependency order** — contracts → extractor → API → web

## Impact assessment

Before making changes, assess which repos are affected:

| Change type | contracts | extractor | API | web |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| New optional field | schema | models + output | DTO + response | types + UI |
| New enum value | taxonomy | rules + signals | enum class | constants + UI |
| New required field | schema | models + output | DTO + validation | types + UI |
| Field rename | schema | models + rules | DTO + mapping | types + UI |
| Field removal | schema | models cleanup | DTO cleanup | types cleanup |

## Evolution steps

### Step 1: Update contracts

```
cd cardsense-contracts
```

1. Edit the relevant schema file under `promotion/` or `recommendation/`
2. If adding an enum value, update the corresponding taxonomy file under `taxonomy/`
3. Update example files (`valid/`, `invalid/`) to cover the new case
4. Validate examples against updated schema

### Step 2: Update extractor

```
cd cardsense-extractor
```

1. Update `models/promotion.py` — Pydantic model fields, enum classes
2. Update `extractor/promotion_rules.py` — if new category/subcategory/condition signals needed
3. Update `extractor/normalize.py` — if field mapping changed
4. Update `extractor/benefit_plans.py` — if benefit-plan schema changed
5. Run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

6. If the change affects output shape, re-run affected bank extractors and verify JSONL output

### Step 3: Update API

```
cd cardsense-api
```

1. Update domain classes under `domain/` — entity fields, enums
2. Update repository mapping — `SqlitePromotionRepository` and `SupabasePromotionRepository` column mapping
3. Update service logic — `DecisionEngine` if filtering/ranking behavior changes
4. Update controller response DTOs if API response shape changes
5. Run tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

6. Pay special attention to `DecisionEngineTest` and integration tests

### Step 4: Update frontend

```
cd cardsense-web
```

1. Update TypeScript types/interfaces that mirror the contract
2. Update API client response parsing
3. Update UI components that display new/changed fields
4. Build check:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Cross-repo validation

Use the `cardsense-pipeline-verify` skill to run end-to-end validation:

1. Re-extract at least one bank to produce JSONL with new schema
2. Import to SQLite
3. Start API and verify new fields appear in responses
4. Verify frontend renders correctly

## Backward compatibility checklist

For **additive** changes (safe):
- [ ] New field has a default value or is optional
- [ ] Existing JSONL files still validate against new schema
- [ ] API handles missing field gracefully (old data in DB)
- [ ] Frontend handles missing field gracefully (API may return old data)

For **breaking** changes (requires coordination):
- [ ] All repos updated in the same release cycle
- [ ] SQLite and Supabase data migrated (or re-extracted)
- [ ] Old API responses no longer served (or versioned endpoint)
- [ ] Frontend deployed after API

## Common patterns

### Adding a new subcategory

1. `cardsense-contracts/taxonomy/` — add to subcategory list
2. `cardsense-extractor/extractor/promotion_rules.py` — add `SUBCATEGORY_SIGNALS` entry
3. `cardsense-extractor/models/promotion.py` — add to `SubcategoryEnum`
4. `cardsense-api` — `Subcategory` enum class (auto-recognized from DB string)
5. `cardsense-web` — add label/icon mapping in `SubcategoryGrid.tsx`

### Adding a new condition type

1. `cardsense-contracts/promotion/promotion-normalized.schema.json` — add to condition type enum
2. `cardsense-extractor/extractor/promotion_rules.py` — add detection signals
3. `cardsense-extractor/models/promotion.py` — add to condition type enum
4. `cardsense-api/domain/` — add condition type enum value
5. `cardsense-api/service/DecisionEngine.java` — add matching logic in `isEligible()`
6. `cardsense-web` — add condition badge/display

### Adding a new field to promotion

1. `cardsense-contracts/promotion/promotion-normalized.schema.json` — add field definition
2. `cardsense-extractor/models/promotion.py` — add Pydantic field (with default)
3. `cardsense-extractor/extractor/normalize.py` — populate field during normalization
4. `cardsense-extractor/sql/cardsense_schema.sql` — add column (with DEFAULT for migration)
5. `cardsense-api/domain/` — add entity field
6. `cardsense-api/repository/` — add column mapping in both SQLite and Supabase repos
7. `cardsense-web` — update TypeScript type and display component
