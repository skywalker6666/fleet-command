# CardSense Status

CardSense is the Taiwan credit-card payment decision engine for answering one checkout-time question:

> Given my cards, merchant, payment method, amount, and today's rules, which card should I use, what do I actually earn, and why might the answer change?

> **Live**: https://cardsense-web.vercel.app
> **Dashboard**: [fleet-command/dashboard](./dashboard/index.html)
> **Last updated**: 2026-05-03
> **Direction docs**: [2026-04-29 Review](./reviews/2026-04-29-cardsense-review/CardSense-Review-2026-04-29.md) + [Product Direction vs iCard.AI](./reviews/2026-04-29-cardsense-review/CardSense-Product-Direction-vs-iCardAI.md)

## Product Position

CardSense is not trying to clone iCard.AI, Money101, or card news SEO directories in the short term. The wedge is:

- **My Wallet**: local-first card selection without collecting card numbers.
- **Transaction decision**: merchant, channel, payment method, amount, eligibility, caps, and date.
- **Trust explanation**: source freshness, valid period, matched rules, excluded rules, assumptions, and confidence.

The request path stays deterministic. LLMs may help parsing, drafting explanations, and QA, but final user-facing money decisions must be reproducible and auditable.

## Open Follow-Ups

| Item | Why it matters | Suggested timing |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Supabase / Cloudflare secret rotation | Vendor-console credentials still need real rotation. | Security — do now |
| Secret scanning | Prevent secrets from entering repos. | Security — do now |
| `recommendation_audits` | Money decisions need request/response, promo versions, engine version, latency, and errors. | 60-90 days |
| `promoId` logical key hardening | Same-title same-day promotions can collide. | 31-60 days |
| Feedback widget upload security | Direct anon upload/insert too exposed for production. | 31-60 days |
| Pinned contracts dependency | Vercel builds should not clone mutable contracts branches. | 31-60 days |
